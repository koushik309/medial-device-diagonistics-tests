Medical Diagnostics Testing Framework
Python Version
Tests
Coverage

A pytest-based testing framework for validating medical diagnostic equipment software, with BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) support.

🏥 Project Overview
Tests three core medical diagnostic components:

ECG Analyzer - Heart rhythm and rate analysis

Blood Pressure Monitor - BP measurement and classification

Pulse Oximeter - Oxygen saturation monitoring

cd medical-diagnostics-tests
pip install -r requirements.txt


Running Tests

# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html:reports/coverage

# Run specific test type
pytest tests/unit/               # Unit tests only
pytest tests/integration/        # Integration tests

Key Components
1. ECG Analyzer
Detects normal/abnormal rhythms

Age-adjusted heart rate evaluation

Example BDD scenario:

gherkin
Scenario: Detect atrial fibrillation
  Given ECG data showing irregular peaks
  When analyzed for patient aged 65
  Then flag "atrial fibrillation" alert
2. Blood Pressure Monitor
Categorizes readings (Normal → Hypertensive Crisis)

Age-specific thresholds

Calibration testing

3. Pulse Oximeter
Altitude-adjusted SpO₂ readings

Pulse rate analysis
